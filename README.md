# Hello C#
This little project will be my very first experience with C#.
I will figuring out how to talk to the command prompt!

## Why C#
As a proud One Piece fan, I really love freedom.
The freedom to be able to do whatever the heck you want!
And C# will give me that freedom in de developer world.
You wanna make a game?
The game away homeslice!
You actually want to make a website instead?
Well, put your back(end) into it and face the challenges from the front(end) on!
Everything is possible in C# if you're crazy enough!


## Installing
The install process was very simple actually.
Thanks to Microsoft having some of the best documentation out there, installing the .NET SDK was a breeze!
I have chosen Rider as my IDE.

## Adventure Time
Currently, my goal is to create a small interactive text-based game.
The user will be presented with different choices, and the choices will impact what kind of adventure the user will be going on.
I'll focus on having the user experience a fun and wacky adventure!

## Final thoughts
As of now, I'm not completely satisfied with the end result.
I still don't know how functions work in C#, so once I learn this in a future project, I want to revisit this one and update it.
Once I know how the functions work, I can write a better interactive text-based game.
